                    <p>Portfolio <span>https://warrene.myportfolio.com</span></p>
                    <p class="portfolio">I'm a second-year student studying at ACC in the Media and Communications track taking the Film and Factual elective. Even though I'm currently considered a second-year student I've actually been studying at ACC for three years. Originally I was interested in learning about game design which is why I ended up spending my first year in the Web and interactive program. After that year though I ended up finding out that I really didn't enjoy the coding aspects of the course so I had to take a step back and revaluate what I wanted to pursue. I found I was interested in the media and communications track which I'm excited to say I'm looking to graduate from this year. 
                        I joined ACC because it is a school that has its students learn by doing which is great for me because learning through application is way easier and more enjoyable then learning purely through theory. When I completing projects for the Media and Communications track I find myself genuinely enjoying not only the final products I create but also the process involved in making the product as well. 
                        While I've been studying I've learned that I have a love for hosting, I found that I really enjoyed that specific form of presenting information to people and getting a point across, it doesn't even necessarily need to be me trying to convince people to agree with my opinion, the actual act of informing others is what draws me to the type of work hosting would allow me to do. In my studies I've also figured out after a period of time I spent attempting to learn to screen write which is a mainly solo pursuit, that I prefer collaborating and working in teams over working alone because I feel that having multiple opinions available all focused on improving a product,  helps to create a better final product in the end which both me and the group I'm working with can take pride in.   
                        When I'm out in the field my goal is going to be to keep learning whatever I can in an effort to be ready for when new exciting opportunities will inevitably present themselves to me. Even if it means that I have to start by being a production assistant on set, I'm more then willing to do it if it allows me to branch out and interact with environments that would help me in developing the connections and skills needed to grasp on to those opportunities. So long as I'm working in a team I know I'll have more new and exciting things to learn.</p>
