                <p class="portfolio">Michelle Pineda Henriquez is a graduating student at Assiniboine Community College in the Digital Art and Design program. Ever since she was little, from the time of finger paintings, art has been a massive part of their life and something they have always enjoyed. After pursuing all sorts of digital art and graphic design classes in high school, they made their way into the program following the recommendation of a teacher. 
                    Inspired by the works of artists, game developers and story tellers like that of Toby Fox, the creator of the popular game Undertale, Michelle works in 2d animation and drawing, creating characters and stories of his own. Additionally, they have been working with the Leech Group in Brandon to boost the skills they have been taught regarding everything print. With practicum placements just around the corner, a department change is in order, moving from working in print to working alongside the graphic designers to further more of the skills learned over the past two years in a more practical setting.
                    After almost two full years of being a student in the Digital Art and Design program, Michelle had advice for his younger self. "Calm down, you're going to do great... you have time! It doesn't feel like it, but you do have time." Some solid advice which many students going in to their first year, regardless of program, need to be reminded of every once in a while.
                    Keep your eyes out for Michelle in the months ahead as they compete in Skills Manitoba in the 3D contests on behalf of A.C.C!</p>

                    <p class="portfolio">Paige Yanchyki is a second year Digital Art and Design student at Assiniboine Community College. She graduated from Brandon University with a master's degree in history, but after that, she felt that she needed more education in a different field in order to get a good job. She knew that she was an artistic person, and was interested in learning more about web design, so she turned to ACC, not wanting to stray from the city she'd grown up in.
                        Paige is in her second year at ACC in Digital Art and Design, and she's satisfied with where her education has taken her so far. She's found great value in the teaching styles and materials of the college, and is eager to apply her new knowledge and skills to a job in the field after graduating. Whether it's direct employment or some freelance work, Paige is ready to be out there designing graphics and websites of her own. </p>

                <p class="portfolio">After graduating from high school, I really wanted to tie my life with computer development because I believe technologies are our future! 

                    I got  a bachelor of computer engineering. It is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, development, and maintenance of computer systems and their components. Computer engeenering  involves a combination of hardware and software engineering and covers a wide range of topics, including computer architecture, digital electronics, software engineering, computer networks, and artificial intelligence. I decided to dig deeper into the web design and development and went for a Web & Interactive program in ACC!
                    
                    Coding involves writing instructions in a specific programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is an essential skill for anyone who wants to work in the tech industry or develop software applications.
                    
                    With persistence and a willingness to learn, I know I can achieve my goal of becoming a web developer with a strong knowledge of programming languages. I would absolutely  recommend the future students to focus on learning HTML and CSS as I think it is the base for a web developer.
                    
                    Last year is going very stressful. However, time management is 50% of your success! Stay focused and you can achieve your best results! There are some tips for you:
                    1. Prioritize tasks.
                    2. Set goals.
                    3. Allocate time.
                    4. Avoid multitasking.
                    5. Take breaks.
                    6. Eliminate distractions.
                    7. Learn to say no.
                    
                    Web development is a continuous learning process. Be patient and persistent, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it!</p>
