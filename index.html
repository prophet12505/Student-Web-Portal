                    <!-- <p class="portfolio">I'm a second-year student studying at ACC in the Media and Communications track taking the Film and Factual elective. Even though I'm currently considered a second-year student I've actually been studying at ACC for three years. Originally I was interested in learning about game design which is why I ended up spending my first year in the Web and interactive program. After that year though I ended up finding out that I really didn't enjoy the coding aspects of the course so I had to take a step back and revaluate what I wanted to pursue. I found I was interested in the media and communications track which I'm excited to say I'm looking to graduate from this year. 
                        I joined ACC because it is a school that has its students learn by doing which is great for me because learning through application is way easier and more enjoyable then learning purely through theory. When I completing projects for the Media and Communications track I find myself genuinely enjoying not only the final products I create but also the process involved in making the product as well. 
                        While I've been studying I've learned that I have a love for hosting, I found that I really enjoyed that specific form of presenting information to people and getting a point across, it doesn't even necessarily need to be me trying to convince people to agree with my opinion, the actual act of informing others is what draws me to the type of work hosting would allow me to do. In my studies I've also figured out after a period of time I spent attempting to learn to screen write which is a mainly solo pursuit, that I prefer collaborating and working in teams over working alone because I feel that having multiple opinions available all focused on improving a product,  helps to create a better final product in the end which both me and the group I'm working with can take pride in.   
                        When I'm out in the field my goal is going to be to keep learning whatever I can in an effort to be ready for when new exciting opportunities will inevitably present themselves to me. Even if it means that I have to start by being a production assistant on set, I'm more then willing to do it if it allows me to branch out and interact with environments that would help me in developing the connections and skills needed to grasp on to those opportunities. So long as I'm working in a team I know I'll have more new and exciting things to learn.</p> -->

                <p class="portfolio">Michelle Pineda Henriquez is a graduating student at Assiniboine Community College in the Digital Art and Design program. Ever since she was little, from the time of finger paintings, art has been a massive part of their life and something they have always enjoyed. After pursuing all sorts of digital art and graphic design classes in high school, they made their way into the program following the recommendation of a teacher. 
                    Inspired by the works of artists, game developers and story tellers like that of Toby Fox, the creator of the popular game Undertale, Michelle works in 2d animation and drawing, creating characters and stories of his own. Additionally, they have been working with the Leech Group in Brandon to boost the skills they have been taught regarding everything print. With practicum placements just around the corner, a department change is in order, moving from working in print to working alongside the graphic designers to further more of the skills learned over the past two years in a more practical setting.
                    After almost two full years of being a student in the Digital Art and Design program, Michelle had advice for his younger self. "Calm down, you're going to do great... you have time! It doesn't feel like it, but you do have time." Some solid advice which many students going in to their first year, regardless of program, need to be reminded of every once in a while.
                    Keep your eyes out for Michelle in the months ahead as they compete in Skills Manitoba in the 3D contests on behalf of A.C.C!</p>

                    <p class="portfolio">Paige Yanchyki is a second year Digital Art and Design student at Assiniboine Community College. She graduated from Brandon University with a master's degree in history, but after that, she felt that she needed more education in a different field in order to get a good job. She knew that she was an artistic person, and was interested in learning more about web design, so she turned to ACC, not wanting to stray from the city she'd grown up in.
                        Paige is in her second year at ACC in Digital Art and Design, and she's satisfied with where her education has taken her so far. She's found great value in the teaching styles and materials of the college, and is eager to apply her new knowledge and skills to a job in the field after graduating. Whether it's direct employment or some freelance work, Paige is ready to be out there designing graphics and websites of her own. </p>

                <p class="portfolio">After graduating from high school, I really wanted to tie my life with computer development because I believe technologies are our future! 

                    I got  a bachelor of computer engineering. It is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, development, and maintenance of computer systems and their components. Computer engeenering  involves a combination of hardware and software engineering and covers a wide range of topics, including computer architecture, digital electronics, software engineering, computer networks, and artificial intelligence. I decided to dig deeper into the web design and development and went for a Web & Interactive program in ACC!
                    
                    Coding involves writing instructions in a specific programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is an essential skill for anyone who wants to work in the tech industry or develop software applications.
                    
                    With persistence and a willingness to learn, I know I can achieve my goal of becoming a web developer with a strong knowledge of programming languages. I would absolutely  recommend the future students to focus on learning HTML and CSS as I think it is the base for a web developer.
                    
                    Last year is going very stressful. However, time management is 50% of your success! Stay focused and you can achieve your best results! There are some tips for you:
                    1. Prioritize tasks.
                    2. Set goals.
                    3. Allocate time.
                    4. Avoid multitasking.
                    5. Take breaks.
                    6. Eliminate distractions.
                    7. Learn to say no.
                    
                    Web development is a continuous learning process. Be patient and persistent, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it!</p>

RJ's ultimate end goal is to work for Ubisoft in Winnipeg. As a professional game developer, RJ hopes to create a portfolio that showcases all of their skills, from HTML to hard-coded WordPress sites. RJ believes that by demonstrating their progression over the years, potential employers will be more likely to take notice.
                    RJ came into their studies with the mindset that they would be learning a lot.
