                        <p class="portfolio">After graduating from high school, I really wanted to tie my life with computer development because I believe technologies are our future! 

                            I got  a bachelor of computer engineering. It is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, development, and maintenance of computer systems and their components. Computer engeenering  involves a combination of hardware and software engineering and covers a wide range of topics, including computer architecture, digital electronics, software engineering, computer networks, and artificial intelligence. I decided to dig deeper into the web design and development and went for a Web & Interactive program in ACC!
                            
                            Coding involves writing instructions in a specific programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is an essential skill for anyone who wants to work in the tech industry or develop software applications.
                            
                            With persistence and a willingness to learn, I know I can achieve my goal of becoming a web developer with a strong knowledge of programming languages. I would absolutely  recommend the future students to focus on learning HTML and CSS as I think it is the base for a web developer.
                            
                            Last year is going very stressful. However, time management is 50% of your success! Stay focused and you can achieve your best results! There are some tips for you:
                            1. Prioritize tasks.
                            2. Set goals.
                            3. Allocate time.
                            4. Avoid multitasking.
                            5. Take breaks.
                            6. Eliminate distractions.
                            7. Learn to say no.
                            
                            Web development is a continuous learning process. Be patient and persistent, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it!</p>

                        <p class="portfolio">RJ Sul is a talented game developer who grew up as a gamer and loved breaking games to see how they worked. This passion for understanding the inner workings of games eventually led RJ to create games of their own.
                            RJ's interest in game development evolved into a focus on virtual reality (VR) development. RJ exceeded expectations with their work in VR, creating projects that were a great leap forward from what was believed to be possible.
                            RJ's best skills are in HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL, and PHP. These skills allow RJ to work in a variety of different settings and industries. RJ is especially adept at working as part of a team, particularly with designers. RJ has grown comfortable working alongside designers, which makes the development process much smoother.
                            During their time in school, RJ's goals were to create something to take home to showcase their skills, such as a game or project that demonstrated an understanding of how things work. RJ's ultimate end goal is to work for Ubisoft in Winnipeg. As a professional game developer, RJ hopes to create a portfolio that showcases all of their skills, from HTML to hard-coded WordPress sites. RJ believes that by demonstrating their progression over the years, potential employers will be more likely to take notice.
                            RJ came into their studies with the mindset that they would be learning a lot. While they were initially focused on pure development, RJ gained a broad range of skills throughout the course, including design and Photoshop skills. RJ found that they learned more than they ever expected and were able to use many of the skills they learned throughout the rest of their studies.
                            Overall, RJ Sul is a driven and talented game developer with a passion for VR development. Their skills in HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL, and PHP, combined with their ability to work well as part of a team, make them an asset to any project they undertake. RJ's ultimate goal of working for Ubisoft in Winnipeg is within reach, and they are constantly working to build a portfolio that showcases their talents and progression as a developer.</p>
